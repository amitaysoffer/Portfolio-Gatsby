At Taboola I started as an Impl Dev and advanced to a Solution Engineer role. I Oversaw the technical integrations of web and SDK code with high profile publishers from pre-sales stages to launch. I was also heavily involved with the development side- working exclusively with Javascript, HTML and CSS to find creative solutions for top tier clients.
