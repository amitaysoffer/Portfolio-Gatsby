import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

Not so long ago, I was about to start my masters in psychology in Israel. Until then, my working experience included mentoring and treating young adults at hospitals, boarding schools and special programs. As fulfilling as that was, I felt I am not doing what I'm supposed to do. It was around that time that I realized I needed a change.

I am writing these lines with a feeling of strong satisfaction. Thanks to my previous experience at Taboola, an incredible ad-tech company, I now know what is the right path for me. I left Taboola after three wonderful years in which I learned a ton, both professionally and personally. I started my journey as a self-taught developer and I didn't look back ever since.

Today I live in the UK, working hard every day to polish my skills and to write better and cleaner code. So, if you know of any exciting opportunities that you feel would be a good fit please feel free to let me know.
